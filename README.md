Andrive is an application to measure the Time to Headway (THW) for driving
evaluation. It was develop under the supervision of [Michael Krause](http://www.ergonomie.tum.de/author/krause/)

This application is mainly implemented using the 
[OpenCV library](http://opencv.org). The current version performs
- Rear view vehicle detection.
- Distance calculation using classification region size.
- Speed calculation using GPS.
- THW calculation.
